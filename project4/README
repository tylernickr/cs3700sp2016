*** High Level Approach ***
For our crawler, we login using http posts and requests, storing session information.
Once we are logged in, scan the page for any links and secret flags.
Add any secret flags to the list and add any links that we found that we haven't already tried to the queue.
Keep going until we either find 5 secret flags or until we run out of links to traverse.

*** Problems ***
One of the problems that we had was getting the script to login programatically
We also faced a looping issue where if link loops were large enough, we would miss them
Lastly we faced some issues when setting up threading with resource allocation

*** Testing ***
We tested the script primarily by running it on fakebook and used debugging messages and the chrome debugger
