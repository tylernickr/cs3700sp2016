For this project, we took the approach of trying to pass our tests without a complicated implementation of the put methods, and then updated those once we had pushed our code as far as it would go.  We tested our code with numerous print statements, both in our code and in the run script, and ran as many tests as we could.  Getting a balance between the maximum number of packets and latency was probably the biggest challenge, although dealing with the randomness of the simulator also took a lot of work.  At this point, our code will occasionally hang during a couple of the specific cases, but we have been consistently passing the majority of all test cases.
