Our plan for this assignment was to create a socket (wrapping it in an ssl connection if requested), and then connect to the provided host.  Once connected, we sent the initial HELLO message, and then processed each STATUS message until we finally received a BYE message.  We then parsed the secret key from the final BYE message.  We did not encounter any real challenges in this assignment, as the python ssl and socket libraries are very straightforward.  The code was tested primarily by inserting print statements to read each message and the calculated response.  Assertion checks were also temporarily altered to make sure they ended the program when triggered.
